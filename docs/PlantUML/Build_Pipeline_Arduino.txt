' Connections
ino --> merge
h --> merge
core --> combine
lib1 --> combine
lib2 --> combine

merge --> macros
macros --> comments
comments --> assembly
assembly --> optimize
optimize --> objects
objects --> combine
combine --> symbols
symbols --> elf

elf --> objcopy
objcopy --> hex
objcopy --> eep
elf --> size
elf --> nm

note right of preprocessor
  **Preprocessor Steps:**
  1. Merge #include files
  2. Expand #define macros
  3. Remove comments
end note

note left of linker
  **Linker Steps:**
  - Merge .o files
  - Link Arduino Core
  - Resolve external symbols
end note

note bottom of objcopy
  **avr-objcopy:**
  Converts .elf to:
  - .hex (Flash)
  - .eep (EEPROM)
end note
